## Personal opinion

Very interesting task. There are a lot of interesting feature in this project. Perfect for practice your skills. Beautiful design and concept, especially for cat lover like me. I had never used JS before this project. It helped me to understand more about working with APIs and front-end at all. Also now I am in love with TypeScript.) 
And of course, I'd like to thank MacPaw team for such an awesome test task.
